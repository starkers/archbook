The tool 'emerge' is missing, so we need to install it
via the 'dev_install' command.  When prompted, just hit

You may see many errors during 'dev_install' execution.
As long as the result is a working version of 'emerge'
we should be good to go, but YMMV.

I'm sorry, but the disk path ${DISK} is invalid.

For USB install, please specify a /dev/sd<x> path
(where <x> is a lower case letter in the range a-z
corresponding to the intended block device target),

For an eMMC or SD card install, please specify a
/dev/mmcblk<N> path (where <N> is a number in the range
0-9 corresponding to the intended block device target).

Be sure to specify a block device path and *not* merely
a single partition's path, because this tool is designed
to apply a complete partition scheme to the entire target
disk.
